An Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
"LiveScript"
ECMAScript
How to Run JavaScript Code?
Variables
are used to store information / a "named storage" for data
An online shop ==> the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart
A chat application ==> the information might include users, messages, and much more.
Limitations when naming variables in JavaScript
The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.
let ==> is a modern variable declaration
var ==> is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all.
const ==> is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
Exercises
Working with variables
Declare two variables: admin and name.
Assign the value "John" to name.
Copy the value from name to admin.
Show the value of admin using alert.
Giving the right name
Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
Examine the following code:
const birthday = '18.04.1982';

const age = console.log(birthday);

Numbers
are the building blocks of programming logic
+, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --
assignment (=), equality (==), strict equality (===)
